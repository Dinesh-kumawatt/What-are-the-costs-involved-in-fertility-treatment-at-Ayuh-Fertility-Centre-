Fertility treatment costs can feel confusing for many people. Some think IVF costs in lakhs, while others fear there will be hidden charges. But at Ayuh Fertility Centre in Ahmedabad, things are explained clearly, step-by-step.

For basic consultations, charges are quite reasonable â€” usually like a normal doctor visit. If you need tests like hormone levels or ultrasounds, those are billed separately, but affordable.

IUI (Intrauterine Insemination) is one of the more affordable fertility treatments and can cost between â‚¹8,000 to â‚¹15,000 per cycle, depending on medicines and lab support.

IVF is a more advanced process and usually costs between â‚¹80,000 to â‚¹1.5 lakhs per cycle, depending on the patientâ€™s needs. If you need ICSI (which is sperm injection), the price may go slightly higher. Extra medicines, donor eggs, or embryo freezing also come at added cost â€” but nothing is hidden. The doctor and team explain everything before starting.

Ayuh also helps you plan. They wonâ€™t push you to do everything in one shot. They guide based on your medical condition, age, and budget. Payment can sometimes be broken into steps â€” not everything is needed on day one.
